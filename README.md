# Data-Visualisation-Project

This README file gives details of my data visualisation project. 

This is a Python file that requires the installation of the libraries Matplotlib and NumPy.

Tkinter is also used, however this should automatically run in Python. 

The project, when run should open a GUI Tkinter screen with 4 different buttons as options. 

Once one of the buttons has been pressed, the corresponding Matplotlib chart should appear.
